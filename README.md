# Maze ransomware

Cognizant has confirmed that a Friday evening Maze ransomware attack has disrupted its systems. 

IT services giant Cognizant said that it has been hit by the Maze ransomware group in a cyberattack that has caused service disruptions.
Cognizant, a Fortune 500 company that employs close to 300,000 people, said that it is providing customers with indicators of compromise (IoCs) and other technical details of the attack, which first started on Friday. Public details about how the company was attacked, and which services are disrupted, are scant. Threatpost has reached out for further comment.
“Our internal security teams, supplemented by leading cyber-defense firms, are actively taking steps to contain this incident,” the company said in a statement on its website. “Cognizant has also engaged with the appropriate law enforcement authorities.”
